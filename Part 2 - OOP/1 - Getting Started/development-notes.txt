Lecture 1 - What is OOP?
OO is a style of programming that is centred around objects, rather than functions.
There are several languages that support object oriented programming
-C#
-Java
-Ruby
-JavaScript

Many popular frameworks are design popular object oriented concepts in mine like Angular.
Object oritned programming is very important for interviews.


Lecture 2 - Four Pillas of OOP:
A popular interview questions is what are the 4 pilars of OOP.
-Encapsulation - group related variables & functions togther. (reduce complexity) 
-Absctraction - Abstract Complexity away, simple interface eg play & pause (reduces impact of change)
-Inheritance - Extract whats common, eliminates redundant code.
-Polymorphism - Delegate behavior to child (create more flexible & cleaner code)

Before OOP we has procedural progamming which broke our program into a set of functions
with data stored in variables, and functions that operate on them.
It leads to a lot of duplication and spagheti code that becomes a nightmare.
OOP groups related variables and functions into an object.

quote - the best functions are those with no parameters - Uncle Bob - Robert C Martin.
