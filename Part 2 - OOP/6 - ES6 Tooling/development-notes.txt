Lecture 1 - Modules:
----------------------
Eveerything we've done so far has been inside a the index.js file, we're going to look
at building modules using ES6.

file = modules

Benefits of Modules:
-maintainability
-reuse
-abstract


So lets get migrate our Circle class into a module. Remember in the previous lectures
we used a weak map to simulate private properties? Now if we place this in a module,
the weakmap will not be available, so we're finishing off securing our properties.

In ES5 there was no concept of Modules, so some developers came up with some different
ways to mock this using different module formats like.

-AMD - Asynchoronous Module Definition (Browsers)
-CommonJS - NodeJs
-UMD - Universal Module Deinition (browser & node)
-ES6 - Browsers

In the next sections, we're going to look at CommonJS and ES6 Modules, so we don't have
to worry about AMD or UMD, unless your working on some legacy codebase.
