Section - Prototypes:
Lecture 1 - Inheritance:
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of OOP, that enables an object to take on
propeties and methods of another object, and that makes it easy to reuse code 
in different parts of the application.

Parent Class
Shape {
    computeOptimumLocation()
}

Child Classes
//Both Square & Cirle Inherit the common method from Shape
Circle {
    computeOptimumLocation()
}


Square {
    computeOptimumLocation()
}

-Classical & Prototypical Inheritance
As we know in JavaScript, we don't have classes so instead we have Prototypical Inheritance
which is the subject for this section.
