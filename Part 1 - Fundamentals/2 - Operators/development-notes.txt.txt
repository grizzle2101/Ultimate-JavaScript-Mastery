
Lecture 1 - JavaScript operators:
We use operators in conjunction with variables to create expression, and we use these
expressions to implement logic and alghoritms.

operators variables > expressions > alghoritms

Types of Operators:
-arthmetic
-assignment
-comparison
-logical
-bitwise


Lecture 2 - arthmetic operators:

note:
When incrementing or decrementing values, pay close attention to where they're placed.
x++ means increment AFTER the value is displayed.
++x means increment BEFORE displaying the value.

Lecture 5 - Equality Operator:

the == VS === debate:
Strict V loose equality.
console.log(1 === '1'); false
console.log(1 == '1'); true

The main point being with loose equality, JavaScript automatically converts both
values to the type of the first value. So 1 to '1' both convert to 1, and the comparison works.
However some edge cases can result like
true == 1, returns true. We convert the 1 a boolean with the value of true, which obviously
makes no sense to us, 1 and true and NOT the same.

*Strict Equality is MUCH more precise and accurate*
