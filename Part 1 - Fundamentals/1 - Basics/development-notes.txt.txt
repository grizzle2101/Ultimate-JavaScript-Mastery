As this is really just a recap, I am not going to write expansive notes, maybe just
note things I didn't know to fill gaps in my knowledge.


DOT notation vs Bracket Notation:
person.name
person['name']

Which to use?
In general DOT notation provides a simple and clean way to display object properties.
However there are some use cases for bracket notation, like we don't know the values
of person until realtime.
